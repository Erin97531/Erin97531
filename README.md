- 👋 Hi, I’m @Erin97531
- 👀 I’m interested in eLearning, engaging learners in courses and course content, and creating games or interactions for online learners.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make interactions mobile responsive and overall, more accessible (and possibly learn a little more about JavaScript to build more interactions).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be applied to eLearning!
